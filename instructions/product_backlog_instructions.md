# Producty Backlog Instructions

While there are many ways to document requirements, this project will have its functionality defined as User Stories in a **Product Backlog**. Your Backlog will initially be primed with **Epics** that are broken down into **Features** that are broken down into **User Stories**. The backlog will include an `order` column sot hat the most important items can be done first. Ideally dependencies would also be taken into account when assigning the order.   

The row in the spreadsheet will dictate which Features belong to an Epic and which User Stories belong to a Feature.  

Each member of your team ought to contribute about 10 user stories. With about 5 members per team, the product backlog should have about 50 user stories total. This could mean that your entire product (release) is not fully described, and that's okay.  

Each member of your team will provide a complete set of associated **Acceptance Tests Scenarios** for one select User Story.

Each User Story will have a `T-Shirt cost` and a `Priority`.   

The User Story will detail **WHAT** is to be done, not *how* it is to be done. 

You can use any tool of your choosing to track your Backlog (e.g. spreadsheet, Jira). However, you will submit the backlog to Canvas as a spreadsheet (xlsx or csv). Each PBI must have numerous columns that sufficiently describe the workâ€™s status (e.g.: cost, priority). 

You will include Functional and Non-Functional requirements. Each **Product Backlog Item** (PBI) must be clearly identified as one or the other. 


## User Story Template
As a \_\_\_, I want \_\_\_, so that \_\_\_.  

It can seem that the "so that" part is obvious, but sometimes it is not. At times be compelled to repeat the "I want" part in the "so that" part. Do not. In the minority of cases, the reason for doing something truly cannot be clarified, in which case, it can be omitted.
