# Project Summary
Your assigned group will invent a mock, systems-level project. Your team will use Scrum in the creation of your Group Project. Ideally this would all be done in a Project Management tool such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), but to simplify we will be sticking with more rudimentary tools: markdown, spreadsheets, and images. 

You will not be implementing the product. No code will be produced. Instead, you will simulate some phases of the project development and management.

Youâ€™ll have limited time to work on these during class, but you will be given time to conduct your Scrum meeting to coordinate activities. Be prepared to do work outside of class. Each deliverable should be [reviewed](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2005/07/review-this-inspections/) by the team early enough so that modifications can be made before the due date and submission.

## Part #1 
You will submit two documents to Canvas:  
1) PDF of the write-up that was authored with markdown;  
2) Spreadsheet (XLSX) of backlog. 

See the document `report-part1.md` for the template and detailed instructions. It has details on the following.
* Product Description  
* Requirements Gathering  
* Risks  
* SDLC Process  
* Product Backlog (user stories and/or user scenarios, test cases)  

## Part #2  
You will submit two documents to Canvas:  
1) PDF of the write-up that was authored with markdown;  
2) Spreadsheet (XLSX) of Thread Model.  

See the document `report-final.md` for the template and detailed instructions. It has details on the following.
* Architecture Diagrams  
* Design(s) for a low-level module  
* Threat Analysis (submitted as a spreadsheet) 
* Release Strategy   
 
> While the template document uses images from the internet, you must **create your diagrams from scratch**. You may not use an image found on the internet.

Tools to consider for creating your diagrams:  
* Your hand! Just draw it.  
* jira.com  
* miro.com  
* [Visio.office.com](https://visio.office.com)  
* SequenceDiagram.org - [UML Sequence Diagram Online Tool](https://sequencediagram.org/)  
* [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing/uml-diagram-software )  
* [draw.io](https://draw.io)  

You can see a lot of example UML diagrams [here](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/index-examples.html). 

This course is not intended to focus on rigorous architectural diagrams. CSS 370 is a course that goes into more detail on architecture and technical details. Therefore, your diagrams will not be graded on completeness and technical correctness. Instead, you are expected to draw a *consistent* diagram that is somewhat feasible for your product. You are expected to be able to explain what the diagram and its components say. 

Leverage the skillsets of your team. One person should not do all the diagrams. Ideally, each person would do one diagram and the group would review, improve, and approve.  

## Working in GitHub
Teams should install VS Code and enlist in the project set up on GitHub Education. Instructions for how to do this should be in `Canvas`.   

One aspect of this project is to give the team practice working in GitHub: doing pulls, pushes, and resolving merge conflicts. Mr. Stride will have access to the github repository, and he should be able to see frequent contributions made by all team members.    

Another aspect of this project is to give practice writing documentation in markdown. See the document `markdown_cheatsheet.md` for example markdown. There is much more available on the internet.    

## Generating PDF
Students should install the `Markdown PDF` package into VS Code. See the document: `markdown_cheatsheet.md` for more details on this package and how to generate a PDF file from markdown.
