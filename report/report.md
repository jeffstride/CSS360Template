## Product Description
> You will invent a product. Your product can be a completely new idea–-entirely of your own invention. Or, your product can be a spin-off of, or competitor to, an existing product. You can leverage the ideas/projects that came from the “Pick a Model” activity. The primary requirement is that your product is complex enough to comprise multiple systems ([Software Subsystems in Modular Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)). This means that the product should likely have a client and server architecture ([Client-Server Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)) and perhaps services provided by third parties (e.g. [Google Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator), [Supabase or Firebase](https://supabase.com/alternatives/supabase-vs-firebase), or other [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)/[Azure cloud services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products)).  At this time you won’t be detailing the architecture of your product, but it is a good idea to get some level of understanding of all the systems & components at play.  

> Note: You are given some creative license in this assignment to make up stuff and *handwave* when necessary--to overly simplify and make assumptions so that you can be unblocked. However, you should be specific and as realistic as possible.    

### Product Overview
> Provide a two paragraph description of your product, and why you think the product is a good fit for this assignment.

### Customer Description
> Identify the customer. For example: end consumer, a specific business, professional (e.g. dentist, lawyer), government, non-profit organization, or retailer. (This is not an exhaustive list.) Note that your product might have multiple customer types.

### Success Metrics
> Describe the Non-Functional requirements and the critical `ilities` for a successful first release. List the `ilities` using **measurable, specific** and **testable** terms.  

### Monetization
> Describe where the revenue will come from. How will you monetize the product over time? Consider single purchases, subscriptions, and ads. 

### Hardware Needed
> Describe the hardware needed to deliver the final product (mobile, PC, cloud, DataBase, Big Data).

### Team Size
> Describe the expected size of your mock team at its peak. Consider how your team size will grow, or not, during the all various devlepment phases.  

### External Resources
> Consider what non-code related resources your product will need that you may need to purchase or license. This could be content or expert consultants.  

### Product Support
> Describe what product support will look like for your product. How will people get help when they need it? Consider: custom built help file, community supported websites, AI text-based help, call center with human beings.


## Requirements Gathering
> The group will describe how your **mock company** will gather and define the requirements. The methods you use to gather requirements can vary depending on your specific project (e.g. brainstorming, interview, observation, ethnography, JAD). Note that you must create a spreadsheet of **User Stories** that define many of the requirements of your project.   
> You may have to emulate the requirements gathering process by *rollplaying* with your team members to complete the spreadsheet portion of this assignment.  

## Risks
> See the added document `details_on_risk.md` for details on this difficult section.  

> Consider what risks your product and company will be exposed to. Steer clear of the generic risks that are present in virtually all products. Zero in on the risks that are specifically important to your product and team. Consider the severity of the consequences and list out only the most important.  

## SDLC
> You are creating a tailored (and likely hybrid) SDLC that is designed to **manage the risks that matter the most**.  Thoroughly describe your process, do not just name a model.

> Create one or more detailed, custom drawings/diagrams of your processes.
